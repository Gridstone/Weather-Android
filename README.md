# Weather

A simple app to show some weather info

## The plan

### Design
We are keeping it simple! The plan is to recreate the following UI (courtesy of [Muhammad Noufal](https://dribbble.com/muhammad_noufal))

### Data
We will be consuming data straight from OpenWeatherMap API. For this particular screen we will only need [geo endpoint](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo)
API key can be found in `app/build.gradle.kts` already configured as `API_KEY`
